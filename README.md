This repository is dedicated to the MM0 representation of proofs,
particularly proofs of the Metamath Proof Explorer project
(http://us.metamath.org/), and facilities for translating
proofs between different systems such as Metamath, HOL,
and dependently-typed systems.

The current specification of the format is here at
[mm0.md](mm0.md), and there is currently also documentation
for the Haskell reference implementation of the specification
at [mm0-hs/README.md](mm0-hs/README.md).
